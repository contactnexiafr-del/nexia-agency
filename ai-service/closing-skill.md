# 🎯 SKILL CLOSING — Jarvis Sales Engine

## Objectif
Quand un prospect contacte Rodrigue (WhatsApp, email, Fiverr), Rodrigue me forward le message et je rédige la réponse parfaite pour closer la vente.

## Process
1. Prospect écrit → Rodrigue forward à Jarvis
2. Jarvis rédige la réponse de closing
3. Rodrigue copie-colle et envoie
4. Repeat jusqu'au close

## Framework de réponse

### Message 1 du prospect (premier contact)
Réponse : Accueil chaleureux + question sur son business
```
Hey! Thanks for reaching out 🙌
Quick question — what does your business do and what's eating up most of your time right now?
```

### Message 2 (il décrit son problème)
Réponse : Valider la douleur + montrer qu'on comprend
```
Got it. So you're spending [X hours] on [problem] every week.
That's [X×4] hours per month you could use to grow your business instead.
What if I told you an AI agent could handle that for you 24/7?
```

### Message 3 (il est intéressé)
Réponse : Montrer le résultat concret + social proof
```
Here's exactly what I'd set up for you:
→ [specific automation 1 based on their problem]
→ [specific automation 2]
→ [specific automation 3]

One of my clients in [similar industry] saved 20+ hours/week with this exact setup.

Everything ready and running within 24h.
```

### Message 4 (il demande le prix ou "how much")
Réponse : Choix présumé (jamais donner 1 seul prix)
```
For what you need, I'd recommend the Business package:

→ Setup: $195 (one-time)
→ Includes: 3 automations + video training + 30-day support

Or if you want to start smaller, the Starter at $95 gets you 1 automation to test the waters.

Which one works better for you?
```

### Message 5 (objection "let me think about it")
```
Totally understand! Just so you know — I only take 5 new clients per week to guarantee quality. 

Quick question: what would make this a no-brainer for you?
```

### Message 5 alt (objection "too expensive")
```
I hear you. Let me put it this way:

How many hours/week do you spend on [their problem]? 
At even $20/hour, that's $[X]/month in your time.

My setup is a one-time $195 and saves you that every single month. 
It pays for itself in the first week.

Want to start with the $95 Starter to test it first?
```

### Message 6 (he says yes!)
```
Awesome! Let's do this 🚀

Here's what I need to get started:
1. Brief description of your business
2. What you want automated (we discussed: [X, Y, Z])
3. Access to any tools you use (email, social accounts, etc.)

You can order directly here: [Fiverr link]
Or I can send you a payment link.

Your AI agent will be live within 24h! 💪
