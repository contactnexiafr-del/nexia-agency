# Cold Emails — Service AI Agent

## Template 1 : Agences Marketing / Digital

**Objet :** Quick question about your client acquisition process

**Corps :**
```
Hi [NAME],

I noticed [COMPANY] helps businesses with [digital marketing/SEO/branding]. Quick question:

How much time does your team spend on repetitive tasks like lead outreach, content scheduling, or answering client emails?

I build custom AI agents that automate exactly that. One of my clients (a marketing agency) saved 20+ hours/week after I set up their AI employee.

What it does:
→ Finds and qualifies leads automatically
→ Creates social media content in their brand voice
→ Handles initial client inquiries 24/7

Setup takes 24h. Starts at $95.

Would you be open to a quick chat about what this could look like for [COMPANY]?

Best,

## Template 2 : E-commerce Owners

**Objet :** Your Shopify store could run on autopilot

Hi [NAME],

I help e-commerce store owners automate the parts of their business that eat up their time:

→ Customer support (AI answers product questions 24/7)
→ Product descriptions (SEO-optimized, generated in bulk)
→ Review responses (auto-reply to every review in your tone)
→ Social media (weekly posts created automatically)

I set up a custom AI agent for your store in 24 hours. You don't need any technical skills.

Starting at $95 for a single automation, or $195 for a full AI employee.

Interested? Just reply "yes" and I'll send you a demo.

## Template 3 : Coaches / Consultants

Hi [NAME],

I've been helping coaches and consultants set up AI agents that handle their client acquisition on autopilot:

→ Finds potential clients who match your ideal profile
→ Sends personalized outreach emails automatically
→ Books discovery calls while you sleep
→ Creates weekly LinkedIn/social content in your voice

One coach I worked with went from 2 discovery calls/week to 8 — without spending more time on marketing.

I handle the entire setup in 24h. Starts at $95.

Worth a quick conversation?

## Template 4 : Real Estate Agents

**Objet :** Your competitors are using AI to steal your leads

**Corps :**
```
Hi [NAME],

Quick question: how fast do you respond to new property inquiries?

Studies show that responding within 5 minutes = 10x more conversions. But most agents take hours.

I build AI agents for real estate professionals that:
→ Respond to every inquiry instantly (24/7)
→ Qualify leads automatically (budget, timeline, preferences)
→ Schedule viewings without back-and-forth
→ Follow up with cold leads until they're ready

Setup in 24h. Starting at $195.

## Template 5 : Freelancers / Solopreneurs

**Objet :** What if you had an employee who worked 24/7 for free?

**Corps :**
```
Hi [NAME],

As a solopreneur, you wear every hat. What if AI could wear a few of them for you?

I set up custom AI agents that handle:
→ Finding and reaching out to potential clients
→ Responding to emails and messages
→ Creating your social media content
→ Managing invoices and follow-ups

My clients save 15-25 hours/week. Setup takes 24h and starts at $95.

Interested? Reply "AI" and I'll show you what this could look like for your business.
