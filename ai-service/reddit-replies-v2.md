## Thread 1: "You are an absolute moron for believing in the hype of AI Agents"
**URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/1i362yw/

**Notre réponse (calme, factuelle, pas agressive) :**

I get the skepticism — there's a LOT of hype and BS in the AI space right now.

But here's what I've actually seen work in practice:

I install AI agents for small businesses (solopreneurs, freelancers, small agencies). Not the "AGI will replace everyone" kind — practical, boring stuff:

- An AI that sends personalized cold emails to prospects (saves 3h/day)
- A WhatsApp bot that answers customer FAQs 24/7 (saves hiring a VA)
- Content generation that drafts social posts (saves 1h/day)

Are they perfect? No. Do they replace humans? No. But do they save 10-20 hours/week on repetitive tasks? Absolutely.

The key is managing expectations. AI agents aren't magic — they're tools. Like hiring a very fast, very cheap intern who never sleeps but sometimes makes mistakes.

The real scam isn't AI agents — it's people selling $5000 courses about AI agents. The actual implementation is surprisingly affordable.

## Thread 2: "I think everyone is being lied to about AI agents" (r/n8n)

**Notre réponse :**

You're right that most "AI agent" demos are cherry-picked best cases. But the tech works when you set realistic expectations.

I build these for clients daily. What works well:
✅ Lead generation + personalized outreach (email/WhatsApp)
✅ Customer Q&A based on your docs/FAQ
✅ Content drafts (social media, newsletters)
✅ Data extraction and reporting

What still sucks:
❌ Complex multi-step reasoning without human oversight
❌ Anything requiring real-time accuracy (legal, medical)
❌ "Fully autonomous business" — not there yet

The sweet spot is "AI agent + human review." The agent does 80% of the work, the human validates and adds the 20% that matters.

If anyone wants to see what a realistic AI agent setup looks like for a small business, happy to share examples.

## Thread 3: "I built an AI Agent to find and apply to jobs"
**URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1j5bojf/

**Notre réponse :**

This is exactly the kind of AI use case that actually works — automating repetitive, time-consuming tasks.

I do something similar but for businesses: AI agents that handle prospecting, customer support, and content creation.

The pattern is always the same:
1. Identify a task you do 50+ times (applying to jobs, sending emails, answering the same questions)
2. Build an AI agent to handle the repetitive part
3. You review and approve the output

Saves hours every day. Cool project!
