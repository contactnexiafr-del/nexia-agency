## 1. r/AI_Agents — "Business Owner Looking to Implement AI Solutions"
https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_Agents/comments/1ixtp07/

**Réponse à poster :**

I do exactly this — done-for-you AI agent installations for businesses.

Most of my clients don't have technical skills. They tell me what they want to automate (prospecting, customer support, content, admin), and I set everything up in 24-48h.

I've found that contractors/freelancers work best for this because:
1. One-time setup cost vs ongoing salary
2. The agent runs itself after installation
3. You only need someone for updates/improvements

Happy to chat in DM if you want to discuss your specific use case.

## 2. r/AI_Agents — "How Much Does It Cost to Hire AI Agent Developers?"
https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_Agents/comments/1lbyaov/

**Réponse à poster :**
```
Depends on what you need, but here's the real breakdown:

- Basic agent (1 automation): $95-200
- Full business agent (prospecting + support + content): $200-500
- Enterprise custom build: $500-2000+

Agencies charge $5k-20k+ for the same thing. The secret? Most of the work is configuration, not coding. A good freelancer can set up a powerful AI agent in 24h.

I offer this as a service — DM me if you want specifics for your use case.

## 3. r/smallbusiness — "How do I hire someone to build an AI platform?"
https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1f81m1j/

**Réponse à poster :**
```
You don't need a "platform" — you need an AI agent configured for your specific business.

I set these up for small businesses all the time. The agent handles things like:
- Finding and emailing potential clients automatically
- Answering customer questions 24/7
- Creating social media content weekly
- Managing repetitive admin tasks

Setup is usually done in 24-48h. No coding needed on your end.

Feel free to DM me with what you're looking for — happy to give honest advice even if you don't hire me.

## 4. r/Entrepreneur — "I run an AI automation agency (AAA)"
https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/174o7vd/

**Réponse à poster :**

Great post. I'm doing something similar but more focused on done-for-you installations rather than consulting.

My model:
- Client describes their needs (5 min)
- I configure the AI agent (24h)
- Agent runs autonomously

What I've found works best:
1. Start with ONE automation that delivers clear ROI
2. Show results, then upsell more automations
3. Offer monthly maintenance as recurring revenue

The $95-$495 setup + monthly maintenance model has been solid.
